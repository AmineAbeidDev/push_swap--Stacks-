# push_swap

This project requires to make an algorithm to sort a stack of numbers with minimum operation in addition of a program (Checker) to check whether the operation which the algorithm follows actually sorts the program

We are allowd to manipulate the stack using another stack and six operation:

ra: to rotate the stack A (sends the first number to the end of stack A)<br />
rb: to rotate the stack B

rra: to reverse rotate the stack A (sends the last number to the start of stack A)<br />
rrb: to reverse rotate the stack B

pa: to send the first element of stack A to the start of stack B<br />
pb: to send the first element of stack B to the start of stack A

Execute: ./push_swap (set of non-duplicated numbers)<br />
Execute: ./checker (set of operation)
